# Medici beta

Welcome to the first, build of Medici. Named for renaissance Italy's greatest patrons of the arts, Medici is designed to help connect aspiring patrons of the arts to potential clients. Unfortunately, Medici in its current implementation sucks and there are a huge flaws in its architecture. IF you have low standards, its ok insofar as baby's first bitcoin app goes, its passable, but it really has no functionality at the moment beyond emptying the wallet connected to it. In the follwing readme, I will lay out the planning process behind Medici, how I went about building it and its glaring architectural flaws.

## Planning

Coming into this program, I knew I wanted to act on my longstanding fascination with bitcoin. During the group project, my mind began to fall on this subject. It was then that I concluded I wanted to make Bazaar of Baghdad, an app where one user could send some bitcoin to another.
