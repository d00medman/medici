# Medici beta client

Welcome to the front end client of Medici, a app designed to help link prospective donors to artists who need their donation. Meici's front end was build in ember.js and is the first application I have ever built using a front end framework. Medici's is fairly basic, with most of its core functionality being dictated by the back end (which I built first) 

## Planning

Coming into this program, I knew I wanted to act on my longstanding fascination with bitcoin. During the group project, my mind began to fall on this subject. It was then that I concluded I wanted to make Bazaar of Baghdad, an app where one user could send some bitcoin to another. This would serve as the goal and the benchmark in my buildign of Medici. The details regarding the planning and building of the medici Medici API can be found [here](https://github.com/d00medman/mediciAPI). 

When I started building Medici, I set a fairly simple goalAs a result of this engineering-centric goal, I actually did not do a tremendous amount of planning when it comes to the actual build of Medici's client. This can be reflected in my wireframes, which can be described as slapdash to the point of comical. I did not really realize until I started building how essential planning is, especially when building with an opinionated framework like ember. I will recount my difficulties in the building section. As a whole, my engineering centric focus, while viable and productive when building my back end, proved to be very problematic when it came to efficiently creating a working front end.

## Building

Building the Medici client actually proved to be the most difficult and frustrating element of capstone by an extremely wide margin. This was for two reasons. First, that I really did not have a good understanding of what ember being opinionated really meant, and thus dove in and attempted to build an app as though I was using a browser template. I have been told that this approach may have worked using react, but it proved extremely problematic in ember. I spent the weekend leading up to capstone week really struggling to even get a basic component path off the ground. I had really no idea how the file structure worked, how components interacted with each other and how data and actions flowed through these two. Once I was able to secure help in clearing up my knowledge gaps, I found the actual building of the client to be a surprisingly smooth process.

## User Stories and Wireframes

Wireframs can be found [here](http://imgur.com/l1nFU93) and [here](http://imgur.com/uYxkDPd). Given that I started working on my back end, there is much to be desired here. My wireframes were essentially drawn to display the path the user would take in order to make a donation.

User stories (copied from my notebook)

-   As a user, I want to be able to create my account and find the accounts of other users.
-   As a patron user, I want to be able to send bitcoin to artists who have Medici accounts
-   As a paton user, I want to be able to view the work of my favorite artists (unimplemented)
-   As a client user, I want to be able to recieve bitcoin from my fans
-   As a client user, I want to be able to display my work for my fans (unimplemented)
